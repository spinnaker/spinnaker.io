major_minor: 1.36
version: 1.36.3

## [Clouddriver](#clouddriver) 5.90.5

The primary change here is a configuration (defaulted to true) that instead of immediately moving on after a deploy operation instead polls for task completion of the operation.  There
is a case where Google will not complete the operation or even fail the operation and instead of detecting this, spinnaker would go to the next task and fail.  See issue [7170](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/7170) for more information.

This WILL add some extra time on deployments and the legacy behavior can be disabled via a configuration property documented in the enableAsyncOperationWait PR.
