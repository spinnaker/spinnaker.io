  Configure Spinnaker to trigger pipelines based on changes in a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) (GCS) bucket and inject changed GCS objects as [artifacts](/docs/reference/artifacts) into a pipeline.
---

This functionality uses Google's
[Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview) system for delivering
messages to Spinnaker and must be configured to send messages to
Spinnaker's event bus as shown below.

## Prerequisites

If you or your Spinnaker admin have already configured Spinnaker to listen to
Pub/Sub messages from the GCS bucket you plan to publish objects to, you can
skip this section. _One Pub/Sub subscription can be used to trigger as many
independent Spinnaker pipelines as needed_.

You need the following:

* A billing enabled [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects).

  This will be referred to as `$PROJECT` from now on.

* [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/). Make sure to run `gcloud
  auth login` if you have installed `gcloud` for the first time.

* [A running Spinnaker instance](/docs/setup/install/). This guide shows you how
  to configure an existing one to accept GCS messages and download the files
  referenced by the messages in your pipelines.

* Artifact support [enabled](/docs/reference/artifacts/#enabling-artifact-support).  

At this point, we will configure Pub/Sub and a GCS artifact account. The
Pub/Sub messages will be received by Spinnaker whenever a file is uploaded or
changed, and the artifact account will allow you to download these where
necessary.

## 1. Configure Google Pub/Sub for GCS

Follow the [Pub/Sub configuration](/docs/setup/other_config/triggers/google/), in particular, pay
attention to the [GCS
section](/docs/setup/other_config/triggers/google/#receiving-messages-from-google-cloud-storage-gcs)
since this is where we'll be publishing our files to.

## 2. Configure a GCS artifact account

Follow the [GCS artifact configuration](/docs/setup/other_config/artifacts/gcs/).

## 3. Apply your configuration changes

Once the Pub/Sub and artifact changes have been made using Halyard, run

```bash
hal deploy apply
```

to apply them in Spinnaker.

## Using GCS artifacts in pipelines

We will need either an existing or a new pipeline that we want to be triggered
on changes to GCS artifacts. If you do not have a pipeline, create one as shown
below.

## Configure the GCS trigger

Let's add a Pub/Sub trigger to run our pipeline.

{{< figure src="./add-trigger.png" >}}

Next, we must configure the trigger:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| __Type__ | "Pub/Sub" |
| __Pub/Sub System Type__ | "Google" |
| __Subscription Name__  | Depends on your Pub/Sub configuration (from Halyard|
| __Attribute Constraints__ | Must be configured to include the pair `eventType`:`OBJECT_FINALIZE` (See the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications#events)) |
| __Expected Artifacts__ | Must reference the artifact defined previously |

{{< figure src="./pubsub-config.png" >}}


## Configure the GCS artifact

Now we need to declare that the Pub/Sub trigger expects that a specific artifact
matching some criteria is available before the pipeline starts executing. In
doing so, you guarantee that an artifact matching your description is present in
the pipeline's execution context. If no artifact for this description is present,
the pipeline won't start.

To configure the artifact, go to the __Artifact Constraints__ dropdown for the
Pub/Sub trigger configuration, and select __"Define a new artifact..."__ to bring
up the __Expected Artifact__ form.

Enter a __Display Name__, or leave the autogenerated default. In the __Account__
dropdown, select your GCS account. Enter the fully qualified GCS path in the
__Object path__ field. Note: this path can be a regular expression. You can, for
example, set
the object path to be `gs://${BUCKET}/folder/.*` to trigger on any change to an
object inside `folder` in your `${BUCKET}`.

{{< figure src="./expected-artifact.png" caption="`${BUCKET}` is a placeholder for the GCS bucket name that you have configured to receive Pub/Sub messages from above." >}}

## Test the pipeline

If you upload a file to a path matching your configured __Object path__,
the pipeline should execute. If it doesn't, you can start by checking the logs
in the __Echo__ service.
