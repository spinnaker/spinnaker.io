  Standardize and distribute reusable pipelines across your team or among multiple teams.

You can share these templates with your teams within a single application,
across different applications, or even across different deployments of
Spinnaker itself.

Templates can be managed using [spin](/docs/guides/spin/pipeline-templates/) or the UI. To manage templates through the UI, enable the requisite feature flag: `hal config features edit --managed-pipeline-templates-v2-ui true`

> **Note**: You can use `spin` CLI to manage pipelines and pipeline templates,
> but first you need to [install it](/docs/setup/other_config/spin/).

> **Note**: You first need to [enable the feature](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/pipeline-templates/enable/) if you haven't done it yet.

## Structure of a pipeline template

[The underlying structure](/docs/reference/pipeline/templates/) of a pipeline template is very close to the pipeline
JSON configuration format, viewable in the Deck UI. But it includes information
about the variables the template uses.

## The things you can do with pipeline templates

* [Create a template](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/pipeline-templates/create/) based on an existing pipeline.

* Share the template with one or more teams of developers using Spinnaker.

  [Save a pipeline template](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/pipeline-templates/create/#4-save-the-template) to Spinnaker to make it available to developers.

* [Use the `spin` CLI to plan how to parameterize the
template](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/pipeline-templates/plan/) by visualizing a hydrated pipeline.

* [Create a pipeline based on a template](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/pipeline-templates/instantiate/).

* [Override](/docs/guides/user/pipeline/pipeline-templates/override/) template definitions in your pipeline.

* [List and get pipeline templates](/docs/guides/spin/pipeline-templates/).
