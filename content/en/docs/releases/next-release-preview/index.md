Please make a pull request to describe any changes you wish to highlight
in the next release of Spinnaker. These notes will be prepended to the release
changelog.

## Coming Soon in Release 1.37

### Clouddriver

https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/pull/6342 adds retry logic to AWS credential parsing, controlled wih these new configuration properties and their defaults:
```yaml
aws:
  loadAccounts:
    maxRetries: 10
    backOffInMs: 5000
    exponentialBackoff: false
    exponentialBackoffMultiplier: 2
    exponentialBackOffIntervalMs: 10000
```

https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/pull/6344 makes the duration of assume role sessions configurable via a new per-account propery `sessionDurationSeconds` and
```
aws:
  defaultSessionDurationSeconds: (no default value)
```

The per-account property takes precedence.  If neither `aws.defaultSessionDurationSeconds` nor a per-account `sessionDurationSeconds` is set, the duration of assume role sessions is the default provided by the aws sdk. In version 1.12.261, that's 900 seconds.

### Orca
With https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4804, the api `/applications/{application}/pipelines?expand=false&limit=2` performance is improved when using sql as the backend.
Orca's queries to its sql db are optimized while handling the data obtained from front50.
TaskController is refactored to support externalized config properties.

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4825 adds a new configuration property to orca: `echo.events.ignoreTaskEvents` that defaults to false.  When true, orca doesn't send events whose type is "task".  See <https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/features/notifications/#add-a-listening-webhook-to-spinnaker> and <https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/features/notifications/#detailstype> for details.


https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4819 adds the following:
1. **Exclusion of Execution Retrieval for Disabled Pipelines in an Application:**
    - A new configuration has been added to exclude execution retrieval for disabled pipelines in Front50. This can be enabled with:
      ```yaml
      tasks:
         controller:
            excludeExecutionsOfDisabledPipelines: false|true  # Defaults to false
      ```
    - When enabled, Orca will call Front50 with the `enabledPipelines=true` query parameter, which returns only the
      enabled pipelines for an application (Front50 change https://github.com/spinnaker/front50/pull/1520). This helps reduce
      load for applications with numerous pipelines, especially when obsolete, disabled pipelines are retained for historical reasons.

2. **Agent for Disabling Unused Pipelines:**
    - An agent has been introduced to detect and disable unused or unexecuted pipelines within an application.
      This agent checks pipelines that have not been executed for the past `thresholdDays` days and disables them in Front50.
    - This feature is only available for SQL execution repositories and is configurable with the following settings:
      ```yaml
      pollers:
        unused-pipelines-disable:
          enabled: false | true  # default: false
          intervalSec: 3600  # default: 3600
          thresholdDays: 365  # default: 365
          dryRun: false | true  # default: true. When true an info is logged about the intention to disable a pipelineConfigId in the application evaluated
      ```

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4841 adds support for a new pipeline stage configuration property `backoffPeriodMs`.  Before this, pipeline authors had no control over the backoff period. It came from either spinnaker configuration properties or implementations of RetryableTask.getDynamicBackoffPeriod.

This makes it possible for pipeline authors to, for example, control the delay between attempts when webhook stages retry. The actual backoff used is the largest of:

- `backoffPeriodMs` in the stage
- `tasks.global.backOffPeriod`
- `tasks.<cloud provider>.backOffPeriod`
- `tasks.<cloud provider>.<account name>.backOffPeriod`

There are also a number of additions to webhook stages:

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4833 adds an allow list with the following properties:
```
webhook.allowedRequestsEnabled (default: false)
webhook.allowedRequests: (default: empty list)
  - httpMethods: list of strings, e.g. [ "GET" ]
    urlPrefix: "https://my-url:port/path/starts/with"
   ```
Note, if allowRequestsEnabled is true, and allowedRequests is empty, no requests are allowed.

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4837 adds request and response size limits via new config properties `webhook.maxRequestBytes` and `webhook.maxResponseBytes`. The default value for both is 0.
When greater than 0, only requests/responses whose header + body size is less than or equal to the max are allowed.

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4838 adds a new `webhook.followRedirects` property that defaults to true.  When false, webhook stages don't follow redirects.

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4839 adds webhook-specific configuration properties for read and connect timeout with these defaults:

```
webhook:
  readTimeoutMs: 20000
  connectTimeoutMs: 15000
```

If not present, fall back to `ok-http-client.readTimeoutMs` and `ok-http-client.connectTimeoutMs` (same defaults) to mantain behavior where those ok-http-client properties are set.

https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4840 adds a new `webhook.auditLoggingEnabled` config property which defaults to false.  When true, log information about each webhook request and response.

### Igor
With https://github.com/spinnaker/igor/pull/1301, GCB CI supports private pool within the same project, addressing the issue in https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/6600 .
With CloudBuild Options in GCB Manifest
```yaml
steps:
  - args:
      - '-c'
      - 'echo hello'
    entrypoint: bash
    name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/git
options:
  pool:
    name: projects/PROJECT_NAME/locations/REGION/workerPools/WORKER_POOL_NAME
```
BuildClient uses location information from the `pool.name` parameter to find the correct worker pool which resulted in 404 earlier.
Depending on the permission setup, it may be able to use build pools outside the project but it does not support other operation, So it is advised not to use build pools outside the project.

### Rosco

https://github.com/spinnaker/rosco/pull/1135 adds a new configuration property to rosco: `helm.overridesFileThreshold` to help in situations where the overrides in a helm bake manifest stage are long enough to exceed the command line length limit when helm invokes `helm template`. If the total length of override values exceeds `helm.overridesFileThreshold`, rosco writes the overrides to a file and uses the --values option when invoking Helm. The default behaviour (threshold of 0)o retains the current approach of not using a file, regardless of the length of the overrides.

#### Breaking changes:
These configuration properties:
```yaml
tasks:
   days-of-execution-history:
   number-of-old-pipeline-executions-to-include:
```
are replaced by the below configuration along with few more newly added ones:
```yaml
tasks:
   controller:
      days-of-execution-history:
      number-of-old-pipeline-executions-to-include:

      optimize-execution-retrieval: <boolean>
      max-execution-retrieval-threads:
      max-number-of-pipeline-executions-to-process:
      execution-retrieval-timeout-seconds:
```
