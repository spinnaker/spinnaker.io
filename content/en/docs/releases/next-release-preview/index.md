changelog.

## Coming Soon in Release 1.36

### Enhanced pipeline batch update feature
#### Gate
Adds a new enpdoint, POST /pipelines/bulksave, which can take a list of pipeline configurations to save. The endpoint will return a response that indicates how many of the saves were successful, how many failed, and what the failures are. The structure is

```
[
   "successful_pipelines_count"  : <int>,
   "successful_pipelines"        : <List<String>>,
   "failed_pipelines_count"      : <int>,
   "failed_pipelines"            : <List<Map<String, Object>>>
]
```

There are a few config knobs which control some bulk save functionality. The gate endpoint invokes an orca asynchronous process to manage saving the pipelines and polls until the orca operations are complete.

```yaml
controller:
  pipeline:
    bulksave:
      # the max number of times gate will poll orca to check for task status
      max-polls-for-task-completion: <int>
      # the interval at which gate will poll orca.
      taskCompletionCheckIntervalMs: <int>
```

#### Orca
Updates Orca's SavePipelineTask to support bulk saves using the updated functionality in the front50 bulk save endpoint.

With https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4781, keys from the stage context's outputs section can now be removed (there by reducing the context size significantly). 
At present the following tasks support this feature:
* PromoteManifestKatoOutputsTask
* WaitOnJobCompletionTask
* ResolveDeploySourceManifestTask
* BindProducedArtifactsTask

Here is a sample configuration to exclude some of the keys from the above tasks:
```yaml
tasks:
  clouddriver:
    promoteManifestKatoOutputsTask:
      excludeKeysFromOutputs:
      - outputs.createdArtifacts
      - outputs.manifests
      - outputs.boundArtifacts
    waitOnJobCompletionTask:
      excludeKeysFromOutputs:
      - jobStatus
      - completionDetails
    resolveDeploySourceManifestTask:
      excludeKeysFromOutputs:
      - manifests
      - requiredArtifacts
      - optionalArtifacts
  core:
    bindProducedArtifactsTask:
      excludeKeysFromOutputs:
      - artifacts
```

#### Front50
Batch update operation in front50 is now atomic. Deserialization issues are addressed.

Configurable controls are added to decide whether cache should be refreshed while checking for duplicate pipelines:
```yaml
controller:
   pipeline:
      save:
         refreshCacheOnDuplicatesCheck: false // default is true 
```

Batch update call now responds with a status of succeeded and failed pipelines info. The response will be a map containing information in the following format:

``` 
[
    "successful_pipelines_count"  : <int>,
    "successful_pipelines"        : <List<String>>,
    "failed_pipelines_count"      : <int>,
    "failed_pipelines"            : <List<Map<String, Object>>> 
]
```
Here the value for `successful_pipelines` is the list of successful pipeline names whereas the value for `failed_pipelines` is the list of failed pipelines expressed as maps. 

### Manual installation of awscliv2 and aws-iam-authenticator for Debian packages

As of https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/pull/6278, awscliv2 and aws-iam-authenticator are no longer included in clouddriver Debian packages.  To install them manually:

```bash
AWS_CLI_VERSION=2.15.22
curl -s "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-${AWS_CLI_VERSION}.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
./aws/install --update
rm -rf ./awscliv2.zip ./aws

AWS_AIM_AUTHENTICATOR_VERSION=0.6.14
curl -s "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator/releases/download/v${AWS_AIM_AUTHENTICATOR_VERSION}/aws-iam-authenticator_${AWS_AIM_AUTHENTICATOR_VERSION}_linux_amd64" -o aws-iam-authenticator
chmod +x ./aws-iam-authenticator
mv ./aws-iam-authenticator /usr/local/bin/aws-iam-authenticator
```
