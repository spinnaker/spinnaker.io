Please make a pull request to describe any changes you wish to highlight
in the next release of Spinnaker. These notes will be prepended to the release
changelog.

## Coming Soon in Release 1.30

### Spring Boot 2.4

Spinnaker 1.30 uses Spring Boot 2.4, where 1.29 uses Spring Boot 2.3.  Spring
Boot 2.4 considers session data cached by Spring Boot 2.3 invalid.  Therefore,
users with cached sessions will be unable to log in until the invalid
information is removed from the cache.  Open browser windows to Spinnaker are
unresponsive after the deployment until theyâ€™re reloaded.  Executing:

    $ redis-cli keys "spring:session*" | xargs redis-cli del

on Gate's redis instance removes the cached session information.

### doNotEval SpEL helper

The `doNotEval` SpEL helper makes it possible to skip SpEL evaluation in other SpEL helpers e.g. `toJson`.

For example, if the evaluation context is defined only `fileMap` object:

```java
Map<String, Object> fileMap = Collections.singletonMap("owner", "managed-by-${team}");
```

An exception will be thrown in attempt to get JSON because of `fileMap` contains SpEL inside.

```shell
${#toJson(fileMap)}
```

In the given case `fileMap` contains SpEL for another tool e.g. Terraform. Use `doNotEval` to let Spinnaker know
that this SpEL should be evaluated by a different tool. No exceptions are thrown this way.

```shell
${#toJson(#doNotEval(fileMap))}
```

Use a feature flag to enable.

```yaml
# orca-local.yml

expression:
  do-not-eval-spel:
    enabled: true
```

### Changes to the way artifact constraints on triggers work

If you have a pipeline with multiple triggers using different artifact constraints/expected artifacts, these have for a while been evaluated in an unexpected matter.

![Artifact constraints](artifact_constraints.png)

In this example, even though each trigger has its own artifact(s) defined, when one of the artifacts is present, all of the defined artifact constraints on all triggers are evaluated. If _any_ of them is missing, the pipeline will not trigger. This is [fixed](https://github.com/spinnaker/orca/pull/4322) in Spinnaker 1.30 to only consider the artifacts that are defined on the triggered trigger. If you've relied on this bug, you'll need to add manually add all the artifact constraints to all triggers to replicate the previous behavior.

### Clouddriver

- Replace deprecated Azure SDK `com.microsoft.azure:azure` with the new Azure SDK `com.azure.resourcemanager:azure-resourcemanager`
- Add a new `AzureManagedImageCachingAgent` which is caching managed images from the specified region and resource group
- Update `AzureVMImageLookupController` to return the newly cached managed images when `managedImages` query parameter is set to `true`
