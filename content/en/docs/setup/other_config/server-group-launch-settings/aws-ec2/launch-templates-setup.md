> Please note that you should only proceed with this if you have [AWS EC2](/setup/install/providers/aws/aws-ec2) configured as a cloud provider. These features require 1.24 (although some features were launched in previous releases leading up to 1.24).

AWS uses [launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/LaunchTemplates.html) to specify instance configuration information. Launch templates are the successor of launch configurations. This means that any new instance configuration feature from AWS will only be supported by launch templates. 

Spinnaker still supports launch configurations for backwards compatibility, but recommends enabling launch templates to access any new features that AWS adds. 

## Setup Steps
This section summarizes the steps required to set up launch templates if you are new to using AWS in Spinnaker or if you have already been using AWS as one of your cloud providers. 

### New to AWS
If you are new to Spinnaker or even just new to AWS in Spinnaker, we recommend immediately enabling launch template support for all applications. 

1. Update your Clouddriver configuration file, usually `clouddriver.yml`, to enable launch templates for all applications. 
    ```yml
      aws.features.launch-templates.enabled: true
      aws.features.launch-templates.all-applications.enabled: true
    ```
1. Read through the available launch template supported [features](/docs/setup/other_config/server-group-launch-settings/aws-ec2/launch-templates) to determine which features make sense for your users. 
1. Update AWS settings in Deck to enable launch templates and the features you identified. Ensure that `enableLaunchTemplates` is `true`. 
    ```js
      providers: {
        aws: {
          serverGroups: {
            enableLaunchTemplates: true,
            enableIPv6: true,
            enableIMDSv2: true,
            enableCpuCredits: true,
          }
        }
      }
    ```

### Current AWS User
If you already use AWS as a cloud provider in Spinnaker, we recommend migrating to launch templates. Since there may be pre-existing dependencies on launch configurations, we have created some rollout configurations you can utilize for testing and/or migration.

1. Update `clouddriver.yml`. This step can be repeated as needed throughout your rollout. This is an example config where launch templates is rolled out to two applications in production and all of the test account. It also excludes one application completely:
    ```yml
      aws.features.launch-templates.enabled: true
      aws.features.launch-templates.allowed-applications: "myapp:prod:us-east-1,anotherapp:prod:us-east-1"
      aws.features.launch-templates.allowed-accounts: "test"
      aws.features.launch-templates.excluded-applications: "dangerousapp"
    ```
    Review the [rollout configurations](#rollout-configuration) and determine which of these you can *temporarily* utilize for your rollout. If you do not need to rollout, stop here and follow the [new AWS users](#new-to-aws) steps instead. 
1. Read through the available launch template supported [features](/docs/setup/other_config/server-group-launch-settings/aws-ec2/launch-templates) to determine which features make sense for your users. 
1. Update AWS settings in Deck to enable launch templates and the features you identified. Ensure that `enableLaunchTemplates` is `true`. 
  	```js
    // enable launch templates for AWS
    window.spinnakerSettings.providers.aws.serverGroups.enableLaunchTemplates = true;
    
    window.spinnakerSettings.providers.aws.serverGroups.enableIPv6 = true;
    window.spinnakerSettings.providers.aws.serverGroups.enableIMDSv2 = true;
    window.spinnakerSettings.providers.aws.serverGroups.enableCpuCredits = true;
  	```
1. When you are ready for a complete rollout, enable launch templates for all applications and clean up rollout config in `clouddriver.yml`. 
 	```yml
   aws.features.launch-templates.enabled: true
   aws.features.launch-templates.all-applications.enabled: true
   ```

## Rollout Configuration
If you already use AWS, then your applications may have some dependencies on launch configurations that prevent simple feature enabling. The configuration options below were created to aid with testing or a rollout period. Feel free to use whatever combination is best for you. 
If you would prefer to **skip a rollout**, use the configuration in [New to AWS](#new-to-aws).
